## 2D Path Tracing Playground
Welcome to the 2D Path Tracing Playground! This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience with computer graphics, specifically focusing on 2D path tracing. It offers a fun and educational way to explore and understand the fundamentals of ray tracing, vector mathematics, and graphics programming.

#### Project Overview
In this project, we simulate a simple 2D world where rays are cast from a camera to interact with various objects in the scene. The main features of the project include:

Ray Casting: Rays are generated from a camera and tested for intersections with objects in the scene.
Intersection Testing: Rays are checked for intersections with circles, determining the closest points of contact.
Color and Lighting: Intersected points are visualized, with rays changing color upon hitting an object and dimming over time.
#### Key Components
* Camera: Generates rays within a specified field of view (FOV).
* Rays: Cast from the camera to detect intersections with objects.
* Objects: Simple geometric shapes (circles) that rays can intersect with.
* Intersection Result: Stores details about the intersection, such as the hit location, distance, and surface normal.

#### Learning Goals
This project aims to help me:

Understand the basics of ray tracing and how rays interact with objects in a 2D space.

#### Getting Started
Set Up the Project: Clone the repository and follow the build instructions to set up the project on your machine.
Explore the Code: Familiarize yourself with the codebase, which includes classes for vectors, rays, objects, the scene.
Run the Simulation: Execute the program to see the path tracing in action. Observe how rays are cast from the camera, intersect objects.
Modify and Experiment: Try adding new types of objects or changing the camera's FOV. This is your playground to experiment and learn.
